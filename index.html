<h2 align="center"style="color:white;">ABOUT ME</h2>
<p align="center"style="color:white;">Hey! My name's Tiffany or you can call me Tiff and I was born and raised in Hawaii since '02. I am currently employed at Ka Makana Ali'i but don't ask me where I work because I won't tell you. Oh and besides... I go to work to make money, not friends. I also grew up in a family full of gamers but I'm trash so don't hmu. Majority of the games I played included GTA: San Andreas, Red Dead Redemption, COD, Halo, and other OG'S. Recently, I've gotten into Fortnite and Overwatch. I don't really play as much as I'd like to but I'll hop on whenever I get the chance. </p>

<p align="center"style="color:white;">On a more personal note, I am very deeply rooted in my faith. I grew up in the Catholic faith and my family is very religious. Within my church, I'm involved with my ministry: Couples for Christ, and they're basically my second family. I know that not everyone may have the same beliefs as me but that's totally okay and I respect that. All in all, I believe that everything happens for a reason and I will stay true to that. </p>
